## 🔍 2. DC Analysis Results

### **2.1 CMOS Inverter Leakage (Without MTCMOS)**

* Leakage in OFF state: **~1.57 nA**
* Shows typical low static power for CMOS, but not sufficient for deep-submicron applications.

### **2.2 MTCMOS Inverter – Active Mode**

* Measured leakage: **25 nA**
* Higher than ideal inverter due to the use of **LVT logic transistors** for speed.

### **2.3 MTCMOS Inverter – Sleep Mode**

* Leakage reduces to **250 pA**
* Achieves **~100× leakage reduction**
* Confirms successful isolation through HVT sleep transistors

### **2.4 Key DC Observation**

* Sharp transition characteristics maintained in Active Mode
* Leakage dominated behavior seen in Sleep Mode

> **Conclusion:** MTCMOS is highly effective for standby leakage suppression while maintaining active performance.
